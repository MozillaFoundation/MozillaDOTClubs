# MozillaDOTClubs
Mozilla DOT Clubs brings people together locally to explore, participate in and create the open web in an engaging and collaborative way.

[Mozilla Clubs](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/clubs) and [Digital Opportunity Trust (DOT)](https://www.dotrust.org/) are partnering to bring key leadership and web literacy skills to communities in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Jordan and Lebanon. Our objective is to form more than 30 Mozilla Clubs that teach how to read, write and participate on the web in an inclusive and engaging way. We are collaborating with DOT interns and staff to increase the number of informed, active digital citizens in exsisting [DOT locations](https://www.dotrust.org/countries). 

This is an evolving project with a growing number of collaborators, which include DOT staff, Mozilla staff and community volunteers.
